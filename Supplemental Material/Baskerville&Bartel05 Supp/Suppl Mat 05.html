<p><strong>Supplemental Material</strong><br>
  <strong><a href="Baskerville%20Fig.1.pdf">Figure S1.</a></strong> (A) 
  Pilot microarray. miRNA probes were printed to test hybridization and wash conditions. 
  Samples for hybridization to the array were individually labeled with either 
  (Cy3, green) or (Cy5, red), mixed in equamolar amounts, and hybridized to the 
  array at the temperatures indicated. Specific hybridization was observed as 
  either red or green spots on the array, whereas crosshybridization was observed 
  as shades of yellow. Each miRNA probe was selected to test the resolution of 
  the array for single and multiple mismatches between probe sequences. For example, 
  fug-mir-197 and hsa-mir-197 test the resolution of single nucleotide differences 
  within three nucleotides of the 3_ end of the probe sequence. Test probes were 
  also designed to span a range of melting temperatures. As the hybridization 
  temperature was increased, the specificity of the test array was generally improved 
  to a point near 55-60º C (see hsa-mir-148 and hsa-mir-136). (B) Representative 
  sample grid of a microarray. A more extensive microarray was printed with probes 
  covering a set of non-redundant human and mouse miRNA sequences. As a test of 
  the array specificity, the oligonucleotides used to construct the reference 
  sample were split into two different sets and labeled as described above, mixed 
  and hybridized to the array at 57º C. This subgrid contains replicates samples 
  of individual probes (top four rows and bottom four rows); test samples reproducibly 
  hybridize within the array, and little cross-hybridization was observed, although 
  it is visible in some cases (yellow spots in subgrid shown).<br>

  <strong><a href="Baskerville%20Fig.2.pdf">Figure S2.</a></strong> Correlation 
  between cloning frequency and microarray score.<br>
  Small RNAs sequences were amplified from total RNA isolated from C. elegans 
  mixed-stage worms and then dye-labeled for hybridization to the array. Microarray 
  scores for mixed-stage C. elegans samples were compared with published cloning 
  frequencies from the same samples. In general, cloning frequency and chip score 
  are positively correlated (R2. = 0.66), similar to the results comparing cloning 
  frequency to molecular abundance (R2 = 0.78) (Lau et al., 2001).</p>

  <strong><a href="Baskerville%20Fig.3.pdf">Figure S3.</a></strong> Biological 
  replicates of microarray data. Microarray sample libraries were prepared from 
  primary human hepatocytes enriched from two separate transplant-grade livers. 
  Each library was cloned independently and hybridized to the array. The reproducibility 
  of the array data between these samples (R2 = 0.93) suggests that the profile 
  of miRNA expression within organs is consistent and reproducible, as are the 
  methods for amplifying and labeling the miRNA sequences.</p>
