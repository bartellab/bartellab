<p>Mirscan runs on Linux and uses the Python interpreter.  Scripts are executed
by typing <i>python</i> at the command line, followed by the name of the
script that you are executing.</p>

<p>The steps below indicate how one would execute a complete mirscan cycle, which
has three steps: <b>(1) Training:</b> evaluation of the differences between a foreground and a
background set of miRNA hairpins/candidates; <b>(2) Evaluation:</b> scoring of candidate
hairpins based on the scoring matrices developed during training; <b>(3) Cutting:</b> elimination
of candidates with low scores.  The user may bypass the first step by 
<a href="Downloads.html">downloading</a> or sharing a pre-derived scoring matrix.  In 
these cases, it is up to the user to evaluate the relevence of the scoring matrix being used
to the candidate set being evaluated.</p>

<br><br>

<u>(1) Training</u>

<br>

<p><i>mirscanTrainer.py</i> is used to build a table of scores that reflect the frequencies
of each returned value in the foreground (training) set of miRNA candidates versus the
background (candidate) set.  The foreground set is defined by the specified 
<a href="FileFormats.html#train"><i>.train</i>-format</a> file; the background set is defined
by the set of <a href="FileFormats.html#fax"><i>.fax</i>-format</a> files specified in the 
<i>.train</i> file.  The set of criteria being evaluated is defined by the contents of the
specified <a href="FileFormats.html#criteria"><i>.py</i>-formatted criteria</a> file.  Because the
number of background candidates is often far larger than it is practical or useful to evaluate in
order to define the foreground versus background frequencies, a number of randomly-selected background
hairpins to include can be specified as a command-line argument (if "0" is specified, then the entire
background set will be included).  The scoring matrix will be written out to the specified 
<a href="FileFormats.html#matrix"><i>.matrix</i>-format</a> file.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The general form of the <i>mirscanTrainer.py</i> command:</li>
  <ul>
    <li><i>python mirscanTrainer.py</i> [training file] [criteria file] [# background] [matrix file]</li>
  </ul>
</ul>


<br><br>

<u>(2) Evaluation</u>

<br>

<p><i>mirscanExecute.py</i> applies a scoring matrix and set of procedures to a set
of miRNA candidates.  The set of candidates can be either the foreground set (defined by a
<a href="FileFormats.html#train"><i>.train</i>-format</a> file) or a file from the background 
set (defined by a <a href="FileFormats.html#fax"><i>.fax</i>-format</a> file).  The hairpins
will be evaluated based on the set of criteria defined in the specified 
<a href="FileFormats.html#criteria"><i>.py</i>-formatted criteria</a> file using scores from 
the specified <a href="FileFormats.html#matrix"><i>.matrix</i>-format</a> file.
<b>Note: the scoring matrix must have been built using the specified criteria file!</b>
The scores will be written out to the specified <a href="FileFormats.html#scr"><i>.scr</i>-format</a>
score file.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The general form of the <i>mirscanExecute.py</i> command:</li>
  <ul>
    <li><i>python mirscanExecute.py</i> [candidate file] [criteria file] [matrix file] [score file]</li>
  </ul>
</ul>



<br><br>

<u>(3) Cutting</u>

<br>

<p><i>score_cut.py</i> calculates a minimum passing score for miRNA candidates based
on the distribution of scores among the foreground set and then makes a copy of the
specified background file with those candidates whose scores are below the threshold 
removed.  The foreground and background set scores are taken from two specified 
<a href="FileFormats.html#scr"><i>.scr</i>-format</a> files.  The background 
<a href="FileFormats.html#fax"><i>.fax</i>-format</a> file to be filtered and copied 
can be specified along with the name of the new <a href="FileFormats.html#fax"><i>.fax</i>-format</a>
file to be written.  If these two filenames are not given, then statistics will be
printed concerning the threshold score and the number of candidates that would be cut,
but no cut will be made. <b>Note: the specified background score file must contain scores
from the specified background candidate file!</b></p>


<ul>
  <li>The general form of the <i>score_cut.py</i> command:</li>
  <ul>
    <li><i>python score_cut.py</i> [foreground score file] [background score file] <i>[background candidate file] [output candidate file]</i></li>
  </ul>
</ul>
