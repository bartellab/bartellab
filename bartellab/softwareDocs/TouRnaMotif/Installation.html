<p>This module can be used by any <a href="http://python.org">Python</a> interpreter.  It is compatible with
Python 2.3.4 and will likely work with most versions of Python; however, because the Python programming language
is not developed with a strong "do-no-harm" philosophy, it is possible that previous or future versions of Python
will be incompatible with the 21U-RNA motif scoring module as implemented here.</p>

<p>The source code files can be downloaded below.  These files
should be placed into the working directory from which they will be used.  The 21U-RNA motif scoring module can
then be loaded by typing "import touScoreModule" into your script or interactive python session, and the
motif scoring matrix module can be loaded independently by typing "import motifModule".</p>



<p>Download by right-clicking on the links below and selecting "Save as".
Use the linux applications <a href="http://www.gzip.org">gzip</a> and 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tar_(file_format)">tar</a> to 
decompress the file packages.</p>
