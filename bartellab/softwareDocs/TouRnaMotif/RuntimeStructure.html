<a id="motifInterface"><u>Motif interface</u></a>

<p>This interface was designed so that diverse sequence motif scoring systems could be
applied to real sequences in a similar manner, and so that scoring systems with essentially
different methods of evaluation could easily be substituted for one another without changing
the user code.  The interface is a dictionary that must contain the following (string) keys:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><i>"name"</i>: a string with the motif's name (for example, "Large motif").</li>
  <li><i>"string"</i>: a string that describes the motif.</li>
  <li><i>"len"</i>: the integer length of the motif, i.e. the number of positions
       between and including the first position of the motif and the last
       position of the motif.</li>
  <li><i>"apply"</i>: a function that takes one argument (a string) and returns
       a number (i.e. a score) indicating how well the input sequence matches
       the motif.</li>
</ul>


<p>The "name" and "string" keys access motif documentation.  The "name" key is intended as a simple
label, and the "string" key is intended to point to some printable description of the motif (for
instance, a Position-Specific Scoring Matrix might output a tab-delimited table of the scores
assigned to each nucleotide identity at each position).  The "len" key points to the length of sequence
that can be evaluated by the motif scoring system.  It specifies the required length of the input string
taken by the function to which "apply" points.  This function takes a string of the specified length as
its only argument and returns a number.  That number is the score for the motif's match to the provided
sequence.</p>


<br><br><br>

<a id="sequence"><u>SEQUENCE</u></a>

<p>SEQUENCE is the most basic definition of a sequence motif.  It defines a
motif as a string of characters.  Matches to the motif are matches to that
string.</p>

<p>The SEQUENCE constructor takes a string as its argument and returns a motif
interface which considers the motif to be a perfect match to that sequence.</p>

<br><br><br>

<a id="seq_list"><u>SEQ_LIST</u></a>

<p>SEQ_LIST is a definition of a motif where each position of the motif can
have one in a set of identities.</p>

<p>The SEQ_LIST constructor takes a list of strings as its argument.  Each string
in the list represents a position in the motif, and each character in the string
represents an acceptable match for a character in that position.  The special
character '*' anywhere in the position's string represents that ANY character is
acceptable in that position.  The constructor returns a motif interface reflecting
these properties.  An example:<br>
<pre>['C','T','G','T','T','T','C','A','*','*','*','*','GA']</pre></p>


<br><br><br>

<a id="pssm"><u>PSSM</u></a>

<p>The PSSM constructor will take in a text string which is a table of space- or tab-separated
columns depicting nucleotide frequencies and construct a PSSM from it.  The format for the
text string will be like the following example:</p>

<pre>
background   .25  .25 .25 .25
table-name    A   T   G   C
0             50 97   200 31
5             12  4   350 7
</pre>

<p>Requirements of the input string:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Lines must be separated by "\n".</li>
  <li>The first line with text must be background frequencies in float notation.</li>
  <li>The second line with text must have letter keys.</li>
  <li>Lines without text must have no other characters.</li>
  <li>Lines with text must have the same number of entries.</li>
</ul>



<br><br><br>

<a id="two_pssm"><u>TWO_PSSM</u></a>

<p>TWO_PSSM integrates two PSSMs together, and combines their values with a third
value, also derived from a log-odds score; that is the distance between the
two PSSMS.  The starting position of the sequence read is defined by the user
input.  The shorter of the two PSSMs is slid through the permissible range of
positions of the input sequence; at each position, its distance score and motif
score are summed, and the maximum across the set of permitted input values is
returned as a sum with the score from the other, static PSSM.</p>

<p>The constructor takes in two PSSMs.  These can be generated using the PSSM
constructor.  They are given in the order in which they are expected to appear
(5p first). The remaining input is a string reflecting the length distribution.
Its format is similar to that of the PSSM input string, but with integers representing
distances between the two PSSMs as opposed to letters.  The name in that string
will be the name given to the motif.  An example is shown below:</p>


<pre>
name   3   4    5   6     7   8    10  11
blah  47  289 5935 4443 2323 1119 334  23
</pre>


<p>There is no background line at the top because the background assumption is an even
distribution over all available permissable positions.  The string 'blah' can be
anything but whitespace; it is just a placeholder.</p>

<p>TWO_PSSMs have an additional attribute: two_pssm['positions'](seq) will return
the starting positions for pssmA and pssmB as a two-item list of integers.  The
integers will be the indexes of the starting positions for the two pssms in the
input seq, which is a string.</p>



<br><br><br>

<a id="distance_pssm"><u>DISTANCE_PSSM</u></a>

<p>This is like the distance portion of TWO_PSSM, but alone.
The constructor takes in a string reflecting the length distribution.
Its format is similar to that of the PSSM input string, but with integers representing
distances between the two PSSMs as opposed to letters.  The name in that string
will be the name given to the motif.  An example is shown below:</p>


<pre>
# name   3   4    5   6     7   8    10  11
# blah  47  289 5935 4443 2323 1119 334  23
</pre>


<p>There is no background line at the top because the background assumption is an even
distribution over all available permissable positions.  The string 'blah' can be
anything but whitespace; it is just a placeholder.</p>

<p>The distance pssm does not fully implement the PSSM interface because the length value
is meaningless here.  Instead, there are two keys: 'min len' and 'max len',
corresponding to the minimum and maximum key values.</p>

<a id="attributes"><u>touScoreModule Attributes</u></a>

<p>The touScoreModule provides an implementation of the 21U-RNA-associated upstream motif.
The motif is implemented as two PSSMs and a DISTANCE PSSM, bound by the variable names 
<i>largeMotif</i>, <i>distance</i>, and <i>smallMotif</i>.  Several functions are also
provided for applying the 21U-RNA motif to real sequences:</p>

<ul>
  <li>applyScore</li>
  <ul>
    <li><i>Description</i></li>
    <ul><li>Reports the 21U-RNA upstream motif score given the 5p end of the RNA species.  The small
            motif is fixed and applied around the 21U-RNA 5p end.  The large motif is applied at each upstream
            position permitted by the distance matrix.  The returned score is the small motif score
            added to the highest sum of a distance score with its corresponding large motif score.</li></ul>
    <li><i>Arguments</i></li>
    <ul>
      <li><i>seq</i>: the sequence to be scored.  It includes the length of the large motif,
          the maximum possible distance between the two motifs, and the length of the small motif.
          The 5p end of the candidate 21U-RNA is considered given as one nucleotide upstream from
          the end of the sequence.  Two global variables are provided by touScoreModule to aid in
          assembling a sequence across the appropriate span of nucleotides. <i>upLen</i> indicates
          the number of nucleotides to include upstream of the candidate 21U-RNA 5p nucleotide.  <i>downLen</i>
          indicates the number of nucleotides to include downstream of the candidate 21U-RNA 5p nucleotide.
          Neither of these counts includes the 5p nucleotide itself.</li>
    </ul>
    <li><i>Returns</i></li>
    <ul><li>A float with the 21U-RNA motif score for the given sequence.  In the current study, RNAs with scores
            greater than or equal to 7 were classified as 21U-RNAs.</li></ul>
  </ul>
  <li>predictTou</li>
  <ul>
    <li><i>Description</i></li>
    <ul><li>Similar to <i>applyScore</i>, but keeps the large motif fixed and allows the small
            motif to slide across the distances allowed by the distance matrix.  Determines the
            maximum score for the motif by adding the large motif score to the highest sum of a 
            distance score with its corresponding large motif score.</li></ul>
    <li><i>Arguments</i></li>
    <ul>
      <li><i>seq</i>: the sequence to be scored.  Length requirements are the same as for <i>applyScore</i>,
          but without special relationship to the 5p end position for the hypothetical 21U-RNA.</li>
    </ul>
    <li><i>Returns</i></li>
    <ul>
      <li><i>maxScore</i>: the maximum score that the input sequence can give for a 21U-RNA motif match.</li>
      <li><i>maxPosition</i>: the position in the input sequence, indexed from zero, that gives the highest
          21U-RNA motif score when it corresponds to the 5p nucleotide of the hypothetical 21U-RNA.</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <li>findTous</li>
  <ul>
    <li><i>Description</i></li>
    <ul><li>Predicts 21U-RNAs from within the provided sequence based on motif match scores.</li></ul>
    <li><i>Arguments</i></li>
    <ul>
      <li><i>seq</i>: the nucleic acid sequence within which 21U-RNAs will be predicted.  Predictions
          will be made on the sense strand only.</li>
      <li><i>minScore</i>: the minimum upstream motif score that will be annotated as a 21U-RNA.</li>
    </ul>
    <li><i>Returns</i></li>
    <ul><li>A list of integers with the 5p nucleotide positions for 21U-RNAs predicted in the sequence
            to have upstream motif scores greater than or equal to the specified threshold.  Sequence
            positions are indexed from 0.</li></ul>
  </ul>
  <li>downLen</li>
    <ul><li>This is an integer constant; it is the number of nucleotides downstream of the 21U-RNA 
            5p nucleotide that are needed to execute <i>applyScore</i>.</li></ul>
  <li>upLen</li>
    <ul><li>This is an integer constant; it is the number of nucleotides upstream of the 21U-RNA 
            5p nucleotide that are needed to execute <i>applyScore</i>.</li></ul>
</ul>
