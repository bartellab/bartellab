<p>21U-RNAs are members of a diverse class of small RNAs that are expressed in 
<i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>.  They are derived from thousands of loci spread
across chromosome IV and are generated in a manner that is independent
of components of the RNAi pathway.  Their common feature is the presence of an
ustream motif that is largely sufficient to predict their identities and whose
agreement with their consensus sequence correlates directly with the magnitude
of their expression.</p>

<p>Here, I provide a computational tool for scoring the 21U-RNA-associated upstream
motifs.  This tool has been used to predict 21U-RNAs from genomic sequence and to 
classify 21U-RNAs from high-throughput small-RNA sequence datasets.  It is provided
as a module that extends the python programming language.</p>
