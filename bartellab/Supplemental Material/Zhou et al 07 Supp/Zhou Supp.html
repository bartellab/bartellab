  Fig. 4. B cell precursors in the bone marrow of wild-type C57BL/6 mice. Single-cell
  suspensions of bone marrow cells were prepared and stained with antibodies
  against B220, CD43, and IgM, followed by FACS sorting. B cell precursors were
  defined as pro-B (B220+CD43+IgM-) (A), pre-B (B220+CD43-IgM-) (B), or immature
  B cells (IMB) (B220+CD43-IgM+) (B). (C) Splenic mature B cells (B220+IgM+IgD+)
  were isolated from the spleen of a normal C57BL/6 mouse.</p>

  Fig. 5. Ectopic expression constructs. Authentic stem-loop and flanking sequences
  of various lengths on the 5' and 3' side for miR-150 and miR-195 were cloned
  into the MDH.xdna murine retroviral vector. miRNA ectopic expression constructs
  and the empty MDH vector were individually transfected into 293T cells. Forty-eight
  hours after transfection, total RNAs were isolated and loaded onto a 10% denaturing
  polyacrylamide gel. DNA oligo probes that were complementary to each of the
  selected miRNAs were labeled and hybridized to the membrane to detect mature
  miRNAs that can be efficiently processed (20- to 24-nt). miR-150-90nt and miR-150-130nt
  represent retroviral constructs containing miR-150 pre-miRNA and 90 or 130
  nt of flanking sequences on either side of the stem-loop sequences, respectively.
  miR-195-90nt and miR-195-140nt represent retroviral constructs containing miR-195
  premiRNA sequence with 90 or 140 nucleotides flanking sequences on either sides
  of the stem-loop sequences, respectively. Constructs with high processing efficiency
  were selected for bone marrow transplantation.</p>

  Fig. 6. Short-term repopulation analysis of peripheral blood samples. Peripheral
  blood samples were collected at 4 weeks after transplantation from mice that
  were transplanted with hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells infected with miR-150,
  miR-195, or control MDH retroviral supernatant, also expressing GFP. Erythrocytes
  were depleted using ammonium chloride solution. Cells were then stained with
  antibodies against the donor cell surface marker (CD45.2) and against cell
  lineage-specific surface markers (CD4, CD8, CD19, CD11b, and Gr-1), followed
  by FACS analysis. The FACS plot of the donor derived (CD45.2+) cells in the
  blood of one mouse from each group is displayed.</p>
