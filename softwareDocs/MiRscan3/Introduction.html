<p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, non-coding RNAs of ~23 nt that repress the translation of 
messenger RNAs by basepairing with their 3' UTRs.  The mature RNA species are derived from 
primary transcripts that can fold into hairpin secondary structures for recognition and
cleavage by the RNase III enzymes Drosha and Dicer.  While other requirements of the primary
transcripts are somewhat mysterious, all miRNAs derive from the hairpin portions of those
transcripts.  MicroRNA gene annotation has therefore been simplified as the identification
of a mature miRNA sequence along with definition of the hairpin from which it is derived.</p>

<p>Mirscan is intended to identify the most microRNA-like hairpin sequences from an arbitrary
set of candidates.  It does so by comparing a set of features in a foreground set of previously
annotated miRNA hairpins to those features of a background set of candidates.  Those candidates
that most resemble the foreground set can be retained, while the rest can be discarded.  This
process of discarding candidates from a background set that bear the least resemblence to the
foreground set can be repeated iteratively, as each repetition will change the properties of the
background set and thereby adjust the relative importance of various features in distinguishing
between foreground and background.</p>
