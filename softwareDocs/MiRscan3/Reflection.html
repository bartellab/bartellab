<p>The strength of the mirscan system is its flexibility and ease of modification.  The ability to
fluidly modify the features of miRNA hairpins that are examined and the way that they are examined
is crucial as our knowledge of miRNA structure and function continues to evolve.  The efficiency with
which training and evaluation can be performed is also important as miRNAs are examined across the
major clades.  Scoring matrices developed in one model system may not accurately reflect the 
properties of miRNAs in another set of species, so the ability to efficiently generate custom
scoring systems even when the features being examined remain constant increases this tool's utility.
The ability to refine scoring matrices as poor candidates are eliminated also maximizes the power of
log-odds scoring in predicting miRNA genes.</p>

<p>The primary shortcoming of the system's current implementation is the inflexibility of the current
<i>criteria/feature</i> objects.  For instance, the development of independent criteria for examining single-species
versus two-species candidate sets allowed me to avoid having to develop truly flexible N-species 
criteria.  Fortunately, the system's flexibility confines the solution for this shortcoming to
the development of flexible criteria objects, and makes such solutions more accessible to the
comunity by removing the need for re-development of a miRNA-prediction infrastructure to host
such improvements.</p>
