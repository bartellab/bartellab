<p>Mirscan is implemented in python.  Its functionality is divided into three modules, each of 
which is implemented as a python script:  mirscan.py, mstrainer.py, and score_cut.py.</p>

<p><b>mirscan.py</b> evaluates the probabilities of each in a set of candidates being miRNA 
hairpins.  It contains methods for evaluating the features of hairpins (like nucleotide preferences,
number of base pairs, bulge sizes, etc).  Users can change the set of evaluated features to suit
their preferences.  In the system presented here, two variants of this script are presented: 
<i>mirscan.ss.py</i>, which is designed to examine the features of individual hairpin candidates, and
<i>mirscan.ms.py</i>, which is designed to examine candidates that are pairs of presumably orthologous 
hairpins.</p>

<p><b>mstrainer.py</b> generates the scoring matricies that will be applied to candidates by 
mirscan.py.  It compares the features of a user-defined set of foreground miRNA hairpins
with those of a user-defined background set of candidates.  Log-odds scores are generated for
each possible value that can be associated with a feature, each of which reflects the probability
that the given value was derived from a member of the foreground set vs. the background set.
mstrainer.py relies on a user-selected mirscan.py script to provide methods for evaluating 
hairpin features, thus ensuring that changes to the feature evaluation process will always be
reflected in the training process.</p>

<p><b>score_cut.py</b> considers the distribution of scores given to foreground and background
hairpins and generates a new candidate set with those members of the scored background set with 
the least resemblence to the foreground set removed.</p>
